title: Victorian Bali Spas
description:
  Sam Singh, the owner of Victorian Bali Spas which is located in the heart of Ponsonby, wanted to
  renovate his website to make it more modern and user friendly. He wanted to make it easier for his customers to book appointments and find information about the services he offers. To achieve this, I utilised GSAP to create luxurious animations and a clean design to make the website more appealing to his customers.
