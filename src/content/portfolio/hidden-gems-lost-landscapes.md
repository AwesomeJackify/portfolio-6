title: Hidden Gems Lost Landscapes
description: Carolyn Sylvester approached my friend and I to create a website for her virtual art trail which is done in collaboration with the Albert Eden Board. The website was created to showcase the artists involved and allows users to scan a qr code to redirect to the specific page as they travel along the trail.
